<b>CSS Cheatsheet</b>

This is my take on <strong>Codecademy's Build Your Own Cheat Sheet project</strong>. I decided to focus on CSS selectors and combinators. 

I obtained most of my information from:<br>
https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_combinators.asp <br>
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors <br>
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/css-combinators/

I hope my cheatsheet comes in handy! (^â€¿^) <br>
